**SQL Database**

In this assignment, I created tables to hold data from the 6 CSV files, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, we performed:

**1. Data Modeling**
Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.To do this I used this link [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com]

**2. Data Engineering**
Used the information we have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. The most important factor was to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

**3. Data Analysis**
After that we got the complete database, to do the following:

1. Details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. Department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. Employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order,the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
