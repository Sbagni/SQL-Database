In this assignment, I tables to hold data from the 6 CSV files, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, we performed:

1. Data Modeling
Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.To do this I used this link [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com]

2. Data Engineering
Used the information we have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. The most important factor was to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

3. Data Analysis
After that we got the complete database, to do the following:

1. List the details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
